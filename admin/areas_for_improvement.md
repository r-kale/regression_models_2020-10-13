# Areas where we could improve
* Coordinate with UCI to make sure that there is no schedule conflict
* Get the speaker a good mic
  * Maybe get a good tablet?
* Direct channel to the speaker for when there is a tech problem
* Change the schedule so that there is a lot more time for the first module. It took 75 minutes.
* When they went into the break-out rooms, they did not have the questions.
  * We pasted the text into zoom
* Move people to rooms when the number of people drop. We had 5 people per room, I moved people when there were only two people in a room and I kept them together.
* We were giving them 7 min to solve each problem. Maybe a little more time, like 10-12 min.
* We should provide code to read in the data for each exercise. This would save them some time.
* Add time for students to ask questions during each regression
