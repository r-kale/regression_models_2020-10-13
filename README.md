# OCRUG - Regression Models with R Applications

**Sharpen your Data Science skills with this is a hands-on workshop on regression techniques in R.**

## About this Event

This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundation knowledge to effectively use some of the most common regression models used by data scientists. In regression analysis, the nature of the data dictates which model type is appropriate. Models differ depending on the distribution of the response variable. This workshop will introduce four types of models in which the distributions of the response variable are: (i) normal (continuous, with bell-shaped density function), (ii) gamma (continuous, with density having a long right tail), (iii) binary (discrete, assuming values 0 or 1), and (iv) Poisson (discrete, assuming values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.). For each regression, a definition and all must-know facts will be discussed. Further, the expression for the fitted model will be explained and how to interpret estimated regression coefficients will be taught. You will be shown how to use the model for prediction. The course will give examples in R and you will be taught how it create these models and interpret the output. You will work in small groups to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material.

We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.


The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [“Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/), CRC Press, 2018.

## Biography of Dr. Olga Korosteleva

Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). She received her Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics in 1996 from Wayne State University in Detroit, and a Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 2002. Since then she has been teaching mostly Statistics courses in the Master’s program in Applied Statistics at CSULB, and loving it!

Dr. Olga is an undergraduate advisor for students majoring in Mathematics with an option in Statistics. She is also the faculty supervisor for the Statistics Student Association. She is also the immediate past-president of the Southern California Chapter of the American Statistical Association (SCASA). Dr. Olga is the editor-in-chief of SCASA’s monthly eNewsletter and the author (co-author) of four statistical books.

## Set-up Instructions

You have two options for working with the code examples and exercises for the workshop:

### On your own computer
1. Download and install R and RStudio (if you haven't already)
2. Download the examples and exercises code from the workshop GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ocrug/regression_models_2020-10-13](https://github.com/ocrug/regression_models_2020-10-13)
	1. If you don't know how to use Git, download the course files by clicking the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
	2. If you do know how to use Git, clone the repo to your computer
3. Unzip the files (or go to the directory where you cloned the repository), and double click the file called `regression_models_2020-10-13.Rproj`.  This will start RStudio and you can see the examples and exercises code in the two folder called examples and exercises
4. Install the `rcompanion` package.

### Using Rstudio Cloud
1. Create a free account on RStudio Cloud: [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)
2. Go to the workshop project: [https://rstudio.cloud/project/1683550](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1683550)
3. At the top of the project window, Click "Save a Permanent Copy" — it's by the flashing red "Temporary Project" sign.
4. The project and all its files will now be in your own Personal workspace.  You have 15 free hours per month using Rstudio Cloud.
